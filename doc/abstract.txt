  #include <abstract.h>

This header provides the abstract type. It is intended as type argument for abstract orbits. It is a thin wrapper around std::set<rational>. It is needed to leave std::set available for future extension to nominal sets of sets.

This header defines the following class:

class abstract;

It has the following constructors:
----------------------------------
abstract();
Creates an empty abstract.

abstract(std::vector<rational> d);
Creates an abstract containing the elements of the vector d.

abstract(int n);
Creates an abstract containing the element 0 through n-1.

It has the following members:
-----------------------------
std::set<rational> data;
Contained set.

typedef std::set<rational>::iterator iterator;
iterator begin();
iterator end();
size_t size();
Wrappers for easy access of the corresponding functions of data.


Notes:
------
This header also provides equality operators (== and !=) on abstract, and support for outputing it via stream I/O through the operator <<.
