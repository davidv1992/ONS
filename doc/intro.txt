This package provides a framework for calculating with nominal sets with the total order symmetry (e.g. the symmetry (Q,G) where G is the group of monotone bijections). It consists of three main classes with supporting functions, complimented by a number of utility classes.

The primary classes provided by this framework are orbit<T>, nomset<T> and eqimap<Tdom, Trng>. nomset<T> provides the structure of a nominal set, allowing for membership testing and manipulation of such sets. Such a nominal set is represented as the union of 0 or more orbits, represented through the orbit<T> class. This class exposes the basic properties for such an orbit. Finally, eqimap<Tdom, Trng> is used to represent mutable functions on nominal sets.

This is supported by abstract, rational, singleton and variant. Abstract is a type introduced to allow manipulation of abstract orbits, e.g. orbits whose elements have no inherent structure. Rational provides a type corresponding to Q, and singleton is used as a singleton type. Variant is used to represent sum types. It's design is based on the proposal for inclusion in C++17, but it is included here to provide portability to compilers and standard libraries not yet implementing it.

Almost everything in the implementation is provided within the OrbitSets namespace, with implementation details in sub namespaces of that namespace. A notable exception to this is operators, which are in the global scope to prevent issues in name resolving. Each class in the framework is constructed such that copying, assignment and similar work as expected. Notably, where relevant and/or usefull, comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are implemented, and satisfy the axioms for a total order.
