This software aims to be an implementation of nominal sets using orbit representations. Specifically, a set is represented as a collection of orbits, which then describe the individual elements. Currently, only the total order data symmetry is supported. This software is still under active development, and not stable. It probably still contains numerous bugs, and no guarantee is made with respect to stability of interfaces.

The two main classes of interest in this package are nomset<T> and orbit<T>. Orbit is used for the individual orbits, and supports the generation of representative elements and membership queries. Nomset is the set type, it supports membership queries on the whole set. Furthermore, various set-theoretic constructs are implemented, such as nomset_product, nomset_union, nomset_intersect, nomset_filter and nomset_map. These last two function on the assumption that the passed functions are eqivariant, and will have undefined behaviour when that is not the case.

In order to support easier manipulation of functions there is also eqimap, which is used to represent equivariant map.

Finally, a number of support types is defined for defining the underlying datastructures over which we consider nominal sets. Rational provides a type for rational numbers. Singleton is a single-valued type, and abstract is used to represent sorted sets of rational numbers, used primarily for abstract orbits (orbits with no associated extra structure in their elements beyond the fact that they form an orbit with a given size support). Finally, variant provides a sum type. It's design is partially based on the current draft standard for C++17, and for the most part provides the same interface.
