This software aims to be an implementation of nominal sets using orbit representations. Specifically, a set is represented as a collection of orbits, which then describe the individual elements. Currently, only the total order data symmetry is supported. This software is still under active development, and not stable. It probably still contains numerous bugs, and no guarantee is made with respect to stability of interfaces.

Full documentation of the exposed interfaces by this package can be found in the doc/ directory.
